In JavaScript, there's just **one type of number** â€“ a 64-bit floating-point value. This aligns with Java's `double`. Unlike some other programming languages, **JavaScript doesn't have a separate integer type**. So, both 1 and 1.0 represent the same value.

Creating a number is straightforward, similar to any other variable type. Just use the `var`, `let` or `const` keyword.

You can define numbers using constant values:

```
// This is a float:
let a = 3.5;

// This is an integer:
let b = 20;
```

Alternatively, you can derive a number from the value of another variable:

```
let a = 4;
let b = a;
```

In JavaScript, integers maintain precision up to 15 digits, with the maximum number being 17.

```
let a = 123456789012345;   // m will be 123456789012345
let b = 12345678901234567;  // n will be 12345678901234567
```

Numeric constants are recognized as hexadecimal if they are preceded by 0x.

```
let a = 0xAA; // This evaluates to 170
```
