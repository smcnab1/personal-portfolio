Comments serve as non-executable statements that provide annotations or small descriptions of code in order to enhance code readability and understanding for other programmers. They are also useful for temporarily disabling code without impacting the program's flow.

In JavaScript, comments can be written in two different forms:

1. Single-line comments: They begin with two forward slashes (//) and extend until the end of the line. Any text following the slashes is disregarded by the JavaScript interpreter. For instance:

```
// This is a comment, it will be ignored by the interpreter
let a = "this is a variable defined in a statement";
```

2. Multi-line comments, also known as block comments, are denoted by a forward slash and an asterisk (/) to start, and an asterisk and a forward slash (/) to end. The JavaScript interpreter disregards any content within these markers. This allows for commenting out multiple lines or writing longer explanations. Here's an example:

```
/*
This is a multi-line comment, it will be ignored by the interpreter
*/
let a = "this is a variable defined in a statement";
```

Comments play a crucial role in maintaining code quality, fostering collaboration, and facilitating the debugging process. By offering context and explanations for different sections of code, comments greatly enhance code comprehension in the long run. Including comments is widely recognized as a beneficial practice that contributes to overall code clarity and maintainability.
