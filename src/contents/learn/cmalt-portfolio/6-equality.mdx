When we write programs, it's common to check if variables are equal to other variables. This is where the equality operator comes into play. The most basic equality operator is `==`. It goes to great lengths to establish if two variables are equal, even if they aren't the same type.

For instance, consider the following:

```
let foo = 50;
let bar = 50;
let baz = "50";
let qux = "learn";
```

```
foo == bar // Evaluates to true
baz == qux // Evaluates to false
foo == baz // Also evaluates to true, despite different types
```

Behind the scenes, the `==` equality operator attempts to make its operands the same type before determining their equality. This is different from the `===` equality operator.

The `===` equality operator insists that two variables are only equal if they are of the same type and hold the same value. Given our earlier assumptions, this means `foo === bar` still evaluates to `true`. However, `foo === baz` will now evaluate to `false`. Similarly, baz `===` qux will still evaluate to `false`.
