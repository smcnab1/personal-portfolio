> Problem

Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first n multiples of x.

Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

Return the results as an array or list ( depending on language ).

Examples

```
countBy(1,10) === [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
countBy(2,5) === [2,4,6,8,10]
```

&nbsp;

> Solution

```
const countBy = (x, n) => {
    let result = []

    for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        result.push(x * i)
    }

    return result
}
```

In this JavaScript implementation, we initialize an empty array result. Then, we use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n (inclusive). Inside the loop, we multiply x by the current iteration i and push the result into the result array using the push method. Finally, we return the result array.

For example, `countBy(1, 10)` would return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, and `countBy(2, 5)` would return `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`.
