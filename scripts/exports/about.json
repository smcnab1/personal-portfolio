I have recently been dabbling further in IT & Development whilst working in my role with Immersive Technologies & Simulation.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Although my current role is mainly in healthcare education, the luxury of the team I work within, is that I have ample opportunity to develop and implement new technologies, applications and projects.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The technologies and systems are healthcare focussed within my role. However, I continue to develop \"pet projects\" outside my role to maintain my learning and continue to develop.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I'm looking forward to the possibility of working with you!\n</p>\n",
